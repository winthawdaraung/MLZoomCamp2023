# MLZoomCamp2023


This is my personal repository for the  MLZoomCamp2023 I am currently studying. 
It contains my notes, assignments, and related materials.

Feel free to explore, but please note that this repository is primarily for my own use, and I do not intend for it to be a comprehensive resource for others.
